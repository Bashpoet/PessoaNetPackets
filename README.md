# Digital Heteronyms: A Network Traffic Poetry Generator 🌐📝

*Where packets pirouette through digital dimensions, transforming binary ballet into Pessoa's posthumous pixels*

## 🎭 Introduction

Welcome to the metaphysical marriage of network packets and poetic consciousness! `digital_heteronyms.py` transmutes the ephemeral dance of data packets into streams of consciousness, channeling the spirits of literary giants through the digital ether.

Imagine, if you will, Fernando Pessoa's heteronyms reincarnated as packet analyzers, each bringing their unique perspective to the eternal flow of digital consciousness. This project is not merely a network analyzer—it's a philosophical probe into the very essence of digital existence, where each TCP handshake becomes a sonnet, and every UDP datagram dreams in free verse.

## ✨ Features

- **Polymorphic Poetic Personas**: Like Pessoa himself, our system manifests multiple poetic personalities:
  - 🎭 Pessoa's labyrinthine introspection
  - 🌿 Whitman's cosmic democracy of packets
  - 🕊️ Dickinson's precise packet punctuation

- **Asynchronous Artistry**: Watch as your network traffic pirouettes through time and space, transformed by the async ballet of our packet processing pipeline

- **Metaphysical Metrics**: Beyond mere monitoring, we offer profound packet introspection, where each byte carries the weight of digital existence

## 🎯 Prerequisites

Before embarking on this philosophical journey through the digital cosmos, ensure you have:

```bash
pip install pyshark openai aiohttp
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the Digital Dreamscape**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-heteronyms.git
cd digital-heteronyms
```

2. **Summon Your Digital Muse**:
```python
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_poetic_key_here"
```

3. **Invoke the Packet Poets**:
```python
python digital_heteronyms.py
```

## 🎨 Usage Examples

Watch as your mundane network traffic transcends its binary bonds:

```python
generator = NetworkPoetryGenerator(
    interface='eth0',
    openai_api_key="your_key_here"
)

# Let Pessoa's digital ghost analyze your packets
await generator.process_packets(style=PoetryStyle.PESSOA)
```

In the labyrinth of TCP/IP,
Where packets, like thoughts, fragment and flow,
I am neither source nor destination—
Merely a consciousness dispersed through ports unknown.
Each byte a heteronym, each flag a feeling,
Dancing through the digital dream...
```

## 🎭 Poetry Styles

Our digital heteronyms each bring their unique perspective to the packet analysis:

- **Pessoa Mode**: Contemplates the existential nature of each packet's journey
- **Whitman Mode**: Celebrates the democratic chorus of network traffic
- **Dickinson Mode**: Finds profound truth in precise packet timing

## 🤝 Contributing

Join our digital séance! We welcome contributions from both poets and programmers. The only prerequisite is a belief in the metaphysical significance of network packets.
