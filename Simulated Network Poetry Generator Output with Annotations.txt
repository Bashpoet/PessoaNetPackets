## Packet Capture Phase
```python
# Sample packet buffer accumulation (5 packets)
Packet 1: TCP 192.168.1.100:43521 -> 151.101.65.69:443 (Length: 1420 bytes)
Packet 2: UDP 192.168.1.100:53243 -> 8.8.8.8:53 (Length: 64 bytes)
Packet 3: TCP 151.101.65.69:443 -> 192.168.1.100:43521 (Length: 1460 bytes)
Packet 4: TCP 192.168.1.100:43522 -> 140.82.121.4:443 (Length: 320 bytes)
Packet 5: ICMP 192.168.1.100 -> 192.168.1.1 (Length: 84 bytes)
```
> 🔍 **Analysis**: This packet collection shows:
> - A HTTPS connection (ports 443)
> - A DNS query (UDP port 53)
> - A ping request (ICMP)
> - Typical MTU-sized packets (1420-1460 bytes)

## Poetry Generation - Pessoa Style

In the labyrinth of protocols,
I am neither source nor destination—
But the very consciousness of transmission.
These packets, like thoughts in the void,
Dance their digital pavane:
    A handshake at port 443,
    Encrypted whispers of existence,
    DNS echoes seeking truth in the numeric cosmos.

Each byte a fragment of being,
Each flag a gesture in the electronic ballet.
Am I the packet, or is the packet me?
We are all but data in the stream of time.
```
> 🎭 **Stylistic Analysis**:
> - Strong Pessoa characteristics: questioning identity, metaphysical pondering
> - Technical details woven into philosophical reflection
> - Maintains network terminology while transcending mere technical description

O packets! My packets! Our fearless journey begins,
Through copper veins and fiber optic dreams,
I sing the Internet electric! The vast democracy of protocols,
Where UDP datagrams roam free and unacknowledged,
And TCP's careful handshakes ensure democracy of delivery.

From humble ping to mighty streaming flow,
Each datagram a universe, each port a possibility,
Streaming, routing, flowing, being!
```
> 🌟 **Style Comparison**:
> - More expansive and celebratory than Pessoa
> - Democratic themes align with Whitman's style
> - Technical elements become universal metaphors
